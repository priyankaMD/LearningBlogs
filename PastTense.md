## Past Continuous <br />
The past continuous is used to describe actions that were happening before now. Actions that began in the past and at the time of speaking, were continuing. The past continuous is also very often used to describe what was happening at a moment in the past. We are seeing this type of tense to describe what is happening in the story in the past. <br />

For example:<br />
1) When I arrived home from work, he was read
ing the book.<br />

It means when I go home, he had already started reading the book and was in the process of doing it. All we know is that it was happening then: when I go home.<br />

2) I tried to call him but he was busy watching a movie.<br />

## how to form the past continuous?
We need to use the verb to be when using the past continuous. So for the positive form, the order is subject, was or were, and the verb ending in ing. <br />

For example:
1) I was watching TV.<br />
2) They were calling my name.<br />
3) We were going to the store.<br />

## Past continuous negative<br />
We can make a negative statement by adding not after the verb to be.Was not becomes wasn't. Were not becomes Weren't.<br />

For example:<br />
1) I wasn't visiting the garden.<br />
2) We weren't visiting the museum today.<br />

## Past continuous question statement<br />
To ask questions in the past continuous we use inversion. If you forgot, inversion is when we change the order of the subject and verb then main action verb that ends in ing.<br />

For example:<br />
1) Was I doing it wrong?<br />
2) Were you asking a question?<br />

## Past continuous vs Past simple <br />

In below sentence there are two verbs:

- I was watching television when he arrived.

The first action is a long action - it continued for a period of time. It is a past continuous.

The second action is a short action that has interrupted the first. It is a past simple.

The regular past simple is formed using 'ed' and the past continuous is formed using was/were + verb that ends in ing.
