## Past Continuous: <br />
The past continuous is used to describe actions that were happening before now. Actions that began in the past and at the time of speaking, were continuing. The past continuous is also very often used to describe what was happening at a moment in the past. We are seeing this type of tense to describe what is happening in the story in the past. <br />

For example:<br />
1) When I arrived home from work, he was reading the book.<br />

It means when I go home, he had already started reading the book and was in the process of doing it. All we know is that it was happening then: when I go home.<br />

2) I tried to call him but he was busy watching a movie.<br />

## how to form the past continuous?
We need to use the verb to be when using the past continuous. So for the positive form, the order is subject, was or were, and the verb ending in ing.
