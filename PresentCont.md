## Present Continuous / Progressive : <br />

The present continuous tense is used for actions happening now or for an unfinished action. This tense is also used 
when the action is temporary.<br />

Present continuous tense is formed with the subject plus the present particle form (-ing) of the main verb and the present 
continuous tense of the verb to be: am, is, are.<br />

In the above example "He" is the subject, "is" is the present tense of the verb to be and "learning" is the present continuous verb form.
