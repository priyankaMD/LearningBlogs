[Use of Present Perfect](https://priyankaMD.github.io/LearningBlogs/PresentPerfectUse)

## Use 1 of Present Perfect <br />
We often use just, yet, still and already with the present perfect because they are related to the present moment. <br />

## just <br />
Just used with the present perfect means 'a short time before'.<br />

For Example:<br />
1) I've just seen Harshita coming out of the office.<br />
2) Neha just called me. Can you ring her back, please?<br />

Note: Just comes between the auxiliary verb (have/has) and the past participle.<br />

## yet<br />
Yet used with the present perfect means 'at any time up to now'. We use it to emphasise that we expect something to happen soon. Yet (in this context) is only used in negative sentences and questions.<br />

For Example: <br />
1) Have you finished your homework yet?<br />

Note: Yet comes at the end of the sentence or question.<br />

## still <br />
Still used with the present perfect means that something hasn't happened. We use it to emphasise that we expected the <br />
thing to happen earlier. Still (in this context) is only used in negative sentences.<br />

For example:<br />
1) I've been waiting for an hour and the bus still hasn't come.<br /><br />

Note : Still comes between the subject (the bus, they, etc.) and auxiliary verb (haven't/hasn't).<br />

## already <br />
Already used with the present perfect means 'before now'. We use it to emphasise that something happened before something else or earlier than expected.<br />

For example:<br />
I've already spent my salary and it's two weeks before payday.<br />

Note : Already can come between the auxiliary and the main verb or at the end of the clause.


## Use 2 of Present Perfect (Have ever never)<br />

The second important use of the present perfect is to talk about life experiences, and to do this we use the words ever and never. Ever means ‘at any time’, and never means ‘at no time’. <br />

For example,<br />
1) I’ve never seen a dolphin.<br />
2) He has never travelled outside the country.<br />
3) Has she ever worked for a multinational company?<br /><br /><br /><br />

## Use 3 of Present Perfect (how long have)

You can use the present perfect tense when you want to talk about how long you have done something, or for what amount of time you have done something.<br />

It is used to talk about an action that began in the past and continues up to the present (and will probably continue in the future). <br />

This is the important thing to remember about using the present perfect in this situation: the activity, action, or event is still going on. It has not finished.<br />

For example:<br />
1) I have lived in Mumbai for more than 20 years.<br />
2) I have worked for this company for 13 months.<br />
