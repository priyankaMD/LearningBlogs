[Use of Present Perfect](https://priyankaMD.github.io/LearningBlogs/PresentPerfectUse)

## Use of Present Perfect <br />
We often use just, yet, still and already with the present perfect because they are related to the present moment. <br />

## just <br />
Just used with the present perfect means 'a short time before'.<br />

For Example:<br />
1) I've just seen Harshita coming out of the office.<br />
2) Neha just called me. Can you ring her back, please?<br />

Note: Just comes between the auxiliary verb (have/has) and the past participle.<br />

## yet<br />
Yet used with the present perfect means 'at any time up to now'. We use it to emphasise that we expect something to happen soon. Yet (in this context) is only used in negative sentences and questions.<br />

For Example: <br />
1) Have you finished your homework yet?<br />

Note: Yet comes at the end of the sentence or question.<br />

## still <br />
Still used with the present perfect means that something hasn't happened. We use it to emphasise that we expected the <br />
thing to happen earlier. Still (in this context) is only used in negative sentences.<br />

For example:<br />
1) I've been waiting for an hour and the bus still hasn't come.<br /><br />

Note : Still comes between the subject (the bus, they, etc.) and auxiliary verb (haven't/hasn't).<br />

## already
