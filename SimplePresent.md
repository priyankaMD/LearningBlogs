## Present Simple vs Continious tense:

We use the present simple tense when we want to talk about fixed habits or routines – things that don’t change.<br />

We use the present continuous to talk about actions which are happening at the present moment, but will soon finish.<br />

For example: <br />
(present simple) I eat apple.<br />
(present continuous/ progressive) I am eating apple.<br />

(present simple) ‘I eat apple.’ tells us that eating apple is something the speaker always does. It is part of a routine 
or habit. We can call this a permanent situation.<br />

(present continuous/ progressive) ‘I am eating apple’ tells us that the speaker is eating apple right now. Soon the apple 
will be over. We call this a temporary situation.<br />

## With the present simple we say:<br />

I eat apple<br />
You eat apple<br />
We eat apple<br />
They eat apple<br />
He/she/ it eats apple.<br />

## With the present continuous we say:<br />

I am eating apple<br />
You are eating apple<br />
We are eating apple<br />
He/she/it is eating apple<br />

## Verb Have 

“They have two children.”
“She has a beautiful eyes.”

Note: “have” is a normal verb in English. we can use “do” and “does” in the present tense to make questions, 
and “don’t” and “doesn’t” to make negatives. we can use “did” in the past tense to make questions, 
and “didn’t” to make negatives.

“Do you have any money?”
“Does he have any children?”

“We don’t have much time.”
“She doesn’t have money for shopping.”

“Did he have a good holiday?”
“We didn’t have a holiday last year.”

## Verb “have got”
We can also use “have got” in the present tense to talk about possessions.

I have got a new book from market.
You have got a nice house.
He / she has got an important note.
We have got pizza for lunch.
They have got two beautiful children.
