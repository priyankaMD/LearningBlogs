## Present Simple vs Continious tense:

We use the present simple tense when we want to talk about fixed habits or routines – things that don’t change.<br />

We use the present continuous to talk about actions which are happening at the present moment, but will soon finish.<br />

For example: <br />
(present simple) I eat apple.<br />
(present continuous/ progressive) I am eating apple.<br />

(present simple) ‘I eat apple.’ tells us that eating apple is something the speaker always does. It is part of a routine 
or habit. We can call this a permanent situation.<br />

(present continuous/ progressive) ‘I am eating apple’ tells us that the speaker is eating apple right now. Soon the apple 
will be over. We call this a temporary situation.<br />

## With the present simple we say:<br />

I eat apple<br />
You eat apple<br />
We eat apple<br />
They eat apple<br />
He/she/ it eats apple.<br />

## With the present continuous we say:<br />

I am eating apple<br />
You are eating apple<br />
We are eating apple<br />
He/she/it is eating apple<br />

## Verb Have <br />

“They have two children.”<br /><br /><br />
“She has a beautiful eyes.”<br /><br />

Note: “have” is a normal verb in English. we can use “do” and “does” in the present tense to make questions, <br />
and “don’t” and “doesn’t” to make negatives. we can use “did” in the past tense to make questions, <br />
and “didn’t” to make negatives.<br />

“Do you have any money?”<br />
“Does he have any children?”<br />

“We don’t have much time.”<br />
“She doesn’t have money for shopping.”<br />

“Did he have a good holiday?”<br />
“We didn’t have a holiday last year.”<br />

## Verb “have got”<br />
We can also use “have got” in the present tense to talk about possessions.<br />

I have got a new book from market.<br />
You have got a nice house.<br />
He / she has got an important note.<br />
We have got pizza for lunch.<br />
They have got two beautiful children.<br />
