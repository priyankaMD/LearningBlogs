## 'To Be' Questions (https://priyankaMD.github.io/LearningBlogs/ToBeQuestion)

<br />
To form a question, we are going inversion of the verb 'to be'. All that means is changing the order of the subject and the verb to be.<br /> 

The questions with the verb to be start with either "am is or are".That is, I am becomes "Am I?" He is becomes "is he?" She is becomes "Is she?" It is becomes "Is it?" We are becomes "Are we?" You are becomes "Are you?" They are becomes "Are they?".<br /> 

Examples:<br /> 
1) "Are you in the office?" >> No, I'm on the way of Office.<br /> 
2) "Am I allowed to go to the Goa with my friends?"  >> No you are not.<br /> 
3) "Is it dark outside already?" >> Yeah. It's really dark out.<br /> 


We can ask a lot of different types of questions by putting a question word at the beginning. These question words are who, what, where, when, why and how.<br /> 

For examples:<br /> 
1) What is your favorite movie? >> My favorite movie is 'Avenger: The end Game'.<br /> 

We can use 'what' when we are talking about a specific person, thing, animal or object. <br /> 

2) Which is your favorite movie type Bollywood or Hollywood? >> I like Hollywood movies most.<br /> 

We can use 'which' when there is an option or a choice.<br /> 

3) Where is your office? >> My office is at SB road.<br /> 

We can use 'where' when we are talking about location.<br /> 

4) Who is in the office? >> I'm not sure.<br /> 

We can use 'who' when we are talking about a person.<br /> 

5) Why are they upset? >> They're upset because they failed the test.<br /> 

We can use 'why' to ask for a reason or explanation. <br /> 

6) How are you? >> I am good. how are you?<br /> 

We can use 'how' to ask about a condition, quality, manner and way things are.<br />
