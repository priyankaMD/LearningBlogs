## Use of For, Since , Ago<br />

1) For<br />

For is used to indicate a period of time.<br />

for example:<br />
1) I'm staying for a week in mumbai.<br />
2) He has worked for 2 days.<br />

In above example, period is shown, that's why we used 'for' in it.<br />

2) Since<br />

Since is used to refer to the starting point of actions or situations.It is generally used with the Present Perfect.<br />

for example:<br />
1) I have been waiting for the bus since 8 o'clock.<br />
2) I have lived in Pune since January 2017.<br />

3) Ago<br />

Ago is used to say when past events happened, going back from today towards the past. The verb is in the Past Tense.<br />

for example:<br />
1) I came to pune three years ago.<br />
2) I arrived at the bus stop 10 minutes ago.<br />

## Present perfect vs Past simple<br />

1) Past Simple<br />
We use this tense for things that happened at a definite time in the past.<br />
for example:<br />
"I met my best friend when I was fifteen."<br />

It is formed by adding '-ed' to regular verbs.<br />

2) Present Perfect<br />
This tense describes something that happened in the past, but that is related to something in the present.<br />
for example: <br />
"I have read three books of Chatrapati Shivaji Maharaj"<br />

It is also used to talk about life experiences, recent events or states or things that started in the past and hasn't changed.<br /><br />
for example:<br />
"I have just finished my dinner."<br />


The important thing to remember is that the present perfect is related to the present in some way. Whereas, the past simple <br /><br />
happened at a specific time in the past and is a finished action.<br />

## Present perfect continuous<br />

The present perfect continuous (also called present perfect progressive) is a verb tense which is used to show that <br />
an action started in the past and has continued up to the present moment. <br />

How to form it:<br />
The present perfect continuous is formed using has/have + been + present participle. Questions are indicated by <br />
inverting the subject and has/have. Negatives are made with not.<br />

For exmaple:<br />
1) You have been waiting here for two hours.<br />
2) Have you been waiting here for two hours?<br />
3) You have not been waiting here for two hours.<br />
