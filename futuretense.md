[Future Tense](https://priyankaMD.github.io/LearningBlogs/futuretense)


## Present continuous for future arrangements <br />

The present continuous tense (subject + 'be' = verb-ing) to talk about future arrangements.<br />

There is a suggestion that more than one person is aware of the event, and that some preparation has already happened. <br /><br />

For example:<br />
1) I am leaving tomorrow. I've already bought my train ticket.<br />
2) We're having a staff meeting next Monday, all members of staff have been told about it.<br />


## Going to + Do something<br />

We often use 'be going to' to talk about our future intentions and plans. We have usually made our plans before <br />
the moment of speaking.<br />

For example:<br />
1) We've run out of milk.I know, I'm going to buy some.<br />

We can also use 'be going to' to make a prediction about the future. Often it's possible to use both 'be going to'<br />
and 'will' but it's more common to use 'be going to' if we can see evidence in the present.<br />

For example:<br />
1) The sky is getting darker and darker. It's going to rain.<br />

We can use “will” to describe an event you are as per you wish going to do in the future, or to show that you have agreed <br />
to do something for someone. You can also use it in its negative form to show that you do not agree to do something. <br />

For example: <br />
1) He will come to the dinner party tomorrow.<br />


## will and shall<br />

Will and shall are verbs. They are used with the base form of the main verb (They will go; I shall ask her). Shall is <br />
only used for future time reference with I and we, and is more formal than will.<br />

## Will and shall: uses<br />
1) Predictions: We use will and shall to make predictions and to state facts about the future.<br />
2) Decisions and offers: Will and shall are used to announce decisions and to make offers.<br />

For example:<br />
1) The trains will be late today because of the bad weather.<br />
2) Applicants shall provide evidence of their qualifications.<br />
3) We shall do everything we can to solve the problem.<br />
