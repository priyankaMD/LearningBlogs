## Parts of speech

There are 8 important parts of speech in English and they decide what is the purpose of each word in statement and 
how we use that grammatically.<br />

Working of 8 parts of speech are as follows:<br />

## 1) Nouns :<br />
  - Nouns are the name given to the people, places, things, and ideas.<br />
    For example, <br />
      This is my blog. It is based on English learning. <br />
    In the above example 'blog', 'English' are nouns.<br />
  - We often put an article before the nouns. (Articles -> a, an, the)But they are not always necessary.<br />
  - Nouns are singular, plural, countable or uncountable.<br />
  - Nouns are most of the subject of the sentence.That means the person or things that do something and the object means the action or the change made by the subject.<br />

## 2) Pronoun :<br />
  - A pronoun is a word used in place of a noun. It is a substitute of the noun in the sentence.<br />
  For example, <br />
    Apple is sour in taste sometimes. But it is good for health.<br />
  In the above example 'it' is a substitute for Apple.<br />

## 3) Verb : <br />
  - A verb expresses the action. <br />
  For example, <br />
    I am writing a blog. <br />
  In the above example 'writing' is a verb which shows action.<br />
  
  - A Verb shows the existence of an object.<br />
  For example,<br />
    Now I am a student of English<br />
  It means is not only the action it expresses but also shows the state of being that started in the past, continuous now and 
  will continue until finish studying English completed.<br />
  
  - A verb is also a helping verb that means it connects the different parts of speech together.<br />
  For example, <br />
   You are cooking food for dinner. <br />
  Here 'are'is a verb which is helping to connect the words in a sentence. <br />
  
  
## 4) Adjective :<br />
  - Adjectives are changed,modify, specify and describe the noun and pronoun.<br />
  - They are great because they allow us to add more detail and clarify what we are talking about.<br />
  For example, <br />
    My blog is short and simple. It is easy to understand.<br />
  Here 'short', 'simple' and 'easy' words are adjective of the blog. <br />

## 5) Adverb : <br />
  - Adverbs are just like adjectives, but adverbs never modify nouns and pronouns. They modify the verb action.<br />
  - Most commonly they give the answer to these questions: where, when, why and how something happened.<br />
  For example, <br />
    She passed the exam easily.<br />
  
## 6) Preposition <br />
  - A preposition is a word which links a noun to another word.<br />
  - Prepositions are to, at, after, on, but.<br />
  For example, <br />
    I write this blog after reading support ticket task. <br />
  here 'after' is links 'blog' to another word in sentence<br />

 
## 7) Conjunction<br />
  - A conjunction is a word that joins clauses or sentences or words.<br />
  - A conjunction is - and, but, when.<br />
  For example, <br />
    I like English and I like to write blogs.<br />
 
## 8) Interjection<br />
  - An interjection is a word which is a short exclamation, sometimes inserted into a sentence.<br />
  For example, 
    Hi! How are you?<br />
