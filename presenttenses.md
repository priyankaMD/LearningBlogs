## "To be" verb: (am, is, are)

To be verb is a most important that exists in the English language. So it's most important that we know how to conjugate it.
To conjugate a verb means to change it depending on who the subject is, who is doing the action. As well, with a lot of verbs we can contract them, combine them to make a shorter form with the subject. <br />

## Positive conjugation : 
<br /> In the positive, we have I am, he is, she is, it is, we are, you are, they are. We also have a short form. We contract these into something short forms, like I am becomes I'm. He is he's. She is, she's. It is it's. We are, we're. You are, you're. 
for example,"Tomorrow I am on leave"

Most often in spoken English, we hear this pronounced you're, so exactly the same pronunciation as the possessive pronoun, your. Other times depending on accent or situation. And finally they are becomes they're.It's also the exact same sound of the possessive pronoun their.<br />

## Negative conjugation :
A negative verb is formed by adding "not" to a main verb, making the whole statement untrue it's called negative conjugation.
for example,"I am not".
We can see that how we make this statment negative using 'not', and in the short form, it's "I'm not".
for example, 
"Tomorrow I am not on leave".
"She is not interested in cooking"
"They are not doing homework ontime"


## when do we use the long form? And when do we use the short?
First reason is in spoken English, we like to make things shorter and easier to say, so we contract that and we use short forms more often.So in spoken English the short form, the contracted form ,is much more popular.

In written English, especially in essays or homework. We usually don't contract we prefer the long form, unless we are writing in an informal way like with friends.

In spoken English, we do sometimes use the long form but really only when we want to emphasize something to stress it and focus on it a little bit more. As well, we also use it in very formal situations like an important work meeting or talking to your boss.
