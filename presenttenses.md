## "To be" verb: (am, is, are)

To be a verb is the most important that exists in the English language. So it's most important that we know how to conjugate it.
To conjugate, a verb means to change it depending on who the subject is, who is doing the action. As well, with a lot of verbs, we can contract them, combine them to make a shorter form with the subject. <br />

## Positive conjugation : 
<br /> In the positive, we have I am, he is, she is, it is, we are, you are, they are. We also have a short form. We contract these into something short forms like I am becoming I'm. He is he's. She is, she's. It is it's. We are, we're. You are, you're. <br />
for example, "Tomorrow I am on leave"<br />

Most often in spoken English, we hear this pronounced you're, so exactly the same pronunciation as the possessive pronoun, 'your'. Other times depending on accent or situation. And finally, they become they're. It's also the exact same sound of the possessive pronoun their.<br />

## Negative conjugation :
A negative verb is formed by adding "not" to the main verb, making the whole statement untrue it's called negative conjugation.<br />
for example, "I am not".<br />
We can see that how we make this statement negative using 'not', and in the short form, it's "I'm not".<br />
for example, <br />
"Tomorrow I am not on leave".<br />
"She is not interested in cooking"<br />
"They are not doing homework on time"<br />


## When do we use the long-form? And When do we use the short?
The first reason is in spoken English, we like to make things shorter and easier to say, so we contract that and we use short forms more often. So in spoken English the short form, the contracted form, is much more popular.<br />

In written English, especially in essays or homework. We usually don't contract we prefer the long-form unless we are writing in an informal way like with friends.<br />

In spoken English, we do sometimes use the long-form but really only when we want to emphasize something to stress it and focus on it a little bit more. As well, we also use it in very formal situations like an important work meeting or talking to your boss.<br />

For examples,<br />
1) "I still can't find it. I told you it is over there."<br /> 
In the above example, we didn't contract in the second sentence because it's for stress emphasis.<br />

2) "Mr. Parker, I am looking forward to watching your presentation this morning." <br />
In the above example, we don't contract because it sounds very formal.
