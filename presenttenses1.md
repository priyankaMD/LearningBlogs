##  Negative Statements

Conjugate in the positive statements for the present simple tense are I do, We do, You do, They do, He does, She does, It does. For negative sentence, we use don't and doesn't to make it negative. That is, I don't do, We don't do, You don't do, They don't do, He doesn't do, She doesn't do, It doesn't do. <br />

The first group I/we/you/they use don't for negative sentences. And the second group, he/she/it uses doesn't for negative sentences. <br />

After the negation, doesn't or don't, we put the infinitive. Here are a few more examples:<br />
1) I eat. I don't eat.<br />
2) He eats. He doesn't eat.<br />

Negative contraction: <br />
'Don't' and 'Doesn't' are short forms, contractions of 'do not' and 'does not'. <br />
Because as we know, I, we, you, they do and we add not after it. And do not becomes don't. I, we, you, they don't. We also know that he, she, it does. And we add not after it. And does not becomes doesn't.  <br />


##  Forming questions with the present simple <br />
We put do or does now at the beginning of the question sentence. Then the subject and finally the main verb in the infinitive.<br /> 
For example,<br />
Do I speak?<br />
We use 'do' here because I, we, you, they, all uses 'do'. And 'do' at the beginning that means it's a question. <br />
Does he like to travel? <br />
We use 'does' here because of he, she, it all uses 'does'.   And 'does' at the beginning that means it's a question. <br />

## Short responses and long responses<br />
If we have a question that starts with 'do' or 'does' then we can choose to give a long response or a short response to the question. <br />
For example:<br />
Do you want to come with us?  >> Yeah, I do. (short response)<br />
Do you understand what is required if you get this job? Yes, sir. I do understand and I am eager to succeed. (long response)<br />
If the question is like,<br />
What do you do? <br />
Now, we know that the present simple is about habits and hobbies. So this question does not mean what are you doing? It means, what do you do for work? What is your job? What is your profession? How do you earn money? <br />
A response should be >>  
Hi, I'm Priyanka. I'm a software engineer. What do you do? <br />
