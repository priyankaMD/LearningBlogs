## 'There' vs 'It' <br />

1) There<br />
 - If there is no subject then we use 'there' to talk about.<br />
 
  1) where or when something is:<br />
   e.g There is an interesting book on the shelf.<br />
   
  2) a number or amount:<br />
   e.g There were twenty people at the meeting.<br />
  
  3) something existing or happening:<br />
   e.g. There's a small problem.<br />

2) It<br/>
 - We use 'it' to talk about<br />
  1) times and dates:<br />
    e.g. It's my birthday.
  2) the weather:
    e.g It's raining.
    
 - We use it with the verb be and an –ing form or to-infinitive to express opinions:
  e.g. It's nice to meet you.
  
  
## Passive Voice: Present Simple

Ther are two voices: active and passive. <br />

The active voice is used when the subject of the sentence does the action. <br />

In the example, A is the subject and B is the object.<br />

For example: My mom sings that song.<br />
'My mom' is sbject and 'that song' is object<br />

The passive voice is used when we focus on the object of the sentence.<br />
In the example, B becomes the subject.<br />

For example: That song is sung by my mom.<br />

When it is important to know who does the action, we use by. The noun that follows by is called the “agent.” My mom was the subject in the active sentence, but it becomes the agent in the passive sentence.<br />

We form the passive with be + past participle (3rd form of the verb).<br />

In the present simple, the passive is: am / is / are + past participle (3rd form of the verb).<br />

Note:<br />

The past participle always stays the same. Only the form of be changes.<br />
The subject and verb must always agree in number.<br />

## Passive Voice: Simple Past <br />

Examples:<br />

1) Somebody cleaned the classroom yesterday. (Active)<br />
2) The classroom was cleaned yesterday. (Passive)
<br />
As you can see, the object of an active sentence is the subject of a passive sentence. In an active sentence, the subject is the ‘subject’ of the action and the object is the ‘receiver’ of the action. And in a passive sentence, the subject is the receiver of the action, NOT the subject. <br />

Compare:<br />

A) Somebody broke the window.<br />
B) The window was broken (by someone).<br />
In sentence A, ‘somebody’ is the doer of the breaking, and in sentence B, ‘the window’ is the receiver of the breaking.
